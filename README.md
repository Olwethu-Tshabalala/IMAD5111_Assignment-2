My History Quiz App is a simple and interactive quiz app that I built to make learning American history more engaging and accessible. The app features a short quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions covering key events and figures in U.S. history. My goal was to create a quick and fun way for users to test their knowledge, whether they’re students, teachers, or just curious minds with an interest in history.

I created this project to combine my passion for history with my interest in app development. It’s designed with a clean, user-friendly interface that provides instant feedback, helping users learn as they go. I hope this app offers a useful and enjoyable experience for anyone looking to explore or refresh their understanding of America’s past.

Feel free to try it out, share your feedback, or even contribute to its improvement!
